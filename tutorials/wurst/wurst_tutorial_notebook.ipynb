    "You want to purchase a solar photovoltaic system for the roof of your residence. \n",
    "This system converts sunlight into electricity that powers your home. \n",
    "On days when the system produces more electricity than your home consumes, \n",
    "the excess energy can be stored in batteries for use during nighttime or on days when the sun isn't shining.\n",

    "#### Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Estimate the solar PV installation and storage capacities required for your home energy storage system, considering only \n",
    "the excess solar production that isn't consumed directly by the household during daylight time.\n",
    "2. Add the storage capacity in photovoltaic electricity production datasets\n",
    "3. Estimate the increase in carbon footprint resulting from home energy storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On average, your location in Switzerland receives 5 hours of effective sunlight per day (i.e., full load).\n",
    "2. Your household's electricity consumption is 10 kWh during daylight, and 5 kWh during nighttime.\n",
    "3. You want the storage system to provide enough for the nighttime.\n",
    "4. Batteries typically have a recommended Depth of Discharge (DoD) of 90%, meaning only 90% of their total capacity should be used to ensure a longer lifespan.\n",
    "Energy storage systems have a round-trip efficiency of 80%. This accounts for energy losses during the charging and discharging processes. Also,\n",
    "we assume a 3,000 cycles lifetime for the battery cells (where 1 day = 1 cycle), while the Balance of Plant can outlast the PV installation.\n",
    "Finally, 30% of the battery system mass is the Balance of Plant."
