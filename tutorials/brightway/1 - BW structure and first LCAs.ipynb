       "{'comment': 'This dataset represents the production of high voltage electricity in an average hard coal power plant in Germany in 2012. \"Hard coal\" includes anthracite, coking coal and other bituminous coal according to the definition of the IEA electricity information 2014.\\nAll exchanges in this dataset except for emissions of SO2, NOx and particles are production-weighted averages of the figures in the datasets in ecoinvent version two, which are valid for the following 14 countries: AT, BE, ES, FR, IT, NL, PT, DE, CZ, HR, PL, SK, CN, US. The exception values are production-weighted averages of version 2 countries and the new countries in version 3 (AU, CA, CL, ID, IN, KR, MX, MY, PE, RU, TH, TR, TW, TZ, UA, ZA)\\nComments on the inventory data of emissions: \\n- For the assessment of main characteristics (sulphur and ash content of coal, efficiency of the plant) and CO2 a bottom-up approach has been used. It consists in the collection of information about single plants.\\n- The size distribution of particle emissions has been derived from German data. \\n - Halogene emissions have been estimated on the basis of the content of the species in the country-specific coal input mix, assuming average retention rates. \\n- For CO and particle emissions average values for the former UCTE are included (Union for the Coordination of the Transmission of Electricity, since 2009 replaced by ENTSO-E European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity).   \\n - The country specific emission depend on the share of DeNOx. \\n - Emissions of trace elements were calculated by means of a formula (CORINAIR) using the ash content in the country-specific coal input mix and average transfer coefficients for coal power plants, taking into account the share of DeSOx installed. \\n - Emission of uranium and thorium radioactive isotopes were assumed proportional to the corresponding element emitted with particles; the other non-gaseous radioactive isotopes of the uranium and thorium decay chain were assumed proportional to the emitted U-238 or Th-232.  \\n- The emission of gaseous radon and K-40 are taken from the literature.\\nIEA. 2014.

Please note that in contrast to ecoinvent v2, the two power plant types do not exist anymore as single datasets. Along with (RÃ¶der et al. 2004), lifetime of these power plants is assumed to be 150â€™000 full load hours. Whereas European hard coal power plants are assumed to be operated in mid-load mode with 4000 full load hours per year (corresponding to a lifetime of 37.5 years) (RÃ¶der et al. 2004), a capacity factor (average US) of 66% is documented (eGRID 2006), corresponding to about 5800 full load hours per year, or a lifetime of about 26 years.\\nAverage installed technology.\\n - Share of installed capacity with desulfurisation 2% (rough estimation based on sulfur mass balance\\n - Average efficiency of desulfurisation installations: 92% (rough estimation based on Dones et al. 27\\n - Share of installed capacity with denitrification (primary and/or secondary installations): 73% (figure based on IEA 212 )\\n - Average efficiency of denitrification installations: 8% (estimation based on Dones et al. 27, p.128.
